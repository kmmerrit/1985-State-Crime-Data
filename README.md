# 1985-State-Crime-Data
This project is a multivariate analysis of state crime data from 1985.

This project was completed by me as a midterm for a multivariate analysis class while in graduate school at CSULB. Within the project,
correlations, principal component analysis, and factor analysis (with and without rotations) are used to help determine the best 
states to live in during the year of 1985. 

Note: The data used in this project is included in the SAS code directly instead of in a separate file.
